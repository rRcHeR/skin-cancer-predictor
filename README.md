# skin-cancer-predictor

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based skin cancer detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies images of skin lesions as Cancer or Non-Cancer. The model is trained using image datasets and can be used via a Streamlit web app or a real-time camera feed for detection
ðŸ©º Importance & Usefulness of the Skin Cancer Detection Project
ðŸŒŸ Why is this project important?
Early Detection Saves Lives

Skin cancer, especially melanoma, is one of the most dangerous types of cancer.
Early diagnosis can significantly improve survival rates.
AI-Powered Diagnosis

Reduces dependency on dermatologists for primary screening.
Provides quick & automated detection.
Cost-Effective & Accessible

Many people lack access to expert dermatologists.
AI-based detection can be integrated into mobile apps, telemedicine platforms, and hospitals.
Enhances Clinical Decision-Making

Helps doctors by providing a second opinion.
Reduces misdiagnosis risk and improves efficiency.
Can Be Used in Remote Areas

Useful for rural or underdeveloped regions where dermatologists are scarce.
Can be deployed as a mobile/web application for widespread accessibility.
